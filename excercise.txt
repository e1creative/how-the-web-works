How Web Works Exercise
Part One: Solidify Terminology

In your own terms, define the following terms:

    What is HTTP?
    - http is a transfer protocol.  a standardized way of tranferring data
    What is a URL?
    - a url is human readable address to another computer(s)
    What is DNS?
    - a server that stores/relays the relationship between a url and an ip address
    What is a query string?
    - a part of the url that tells the server what the user is requesting within the current domain
    What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    - get and post.  get requests data from a server.  post mutates data on the server.
    What is an HTTP request?
    - a request for a data from the user to a server.
    What is an HTTP response?
    - the response that the server sends back to the user after analyzing the request
    What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    - a part of the request that sends detailed information about what is being requested.
    - type of data being requested, language of the data being requested
    What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    - the user computer sends a request to a dns server for the computer ip address that is
      associated with the url.  the dns server than relays the request to the computer at
      the IP address.  the server than takes that request, gathers up the information that
      has been requested and sends the data back to the requesting computer.  the requesting
      computer than receives that data, analyzes the information and presents it to the user
      in a human readable format

Part Two: Practice Tools

    Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
    - curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate
    
    Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
    - dig https://icanhazdadjoke.com +short
    - 172.67.211.64
    - 104.21.37.176

    Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.

Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

Part Four: Explore the URL API

At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

Read about the URL API

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
